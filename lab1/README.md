## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### Algorithm Overview

1. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Resize to ensure grid divisibility
   - Optional color quantization (16 levels per channel)
   - RGB format normalization

2. **Grid Division (Vectorized)**
   ```python
   # Efficient grid reshaping using NumPy
   reshaped = image.reshape(grid_size, cell_h, grid_size, cell_w, 3)
   grid_cells = reshaped.transpose(0, 2, 1, 3, 4).reshape(-1, cell_h, cell_w, 3)
   ```

3. **Color Space Conversion**
   - RGB ‚Üí LAB conversion for perceptual uniformity
   - Vectorized processing of all grid cells simultaneously

4. **Tile Matching**
   ```python
   # Vectorized L2 distance calculation
   distances = np.linalg.norm(
       cell_colors[:, np.newaxis, :] - tile_colors[np.newaxis, :, :], 
       axis=2
   )
   best_indices = np.argmin(distances, axis=1)
   ```

5. **Mosaic Reconstruction**
   - Efficient tile placement using advanced indexing
   - Batch resizing of selected tiles

### Performance Optimizations

- **Precomputed LAB Colors**: All tile colors calculated once at startup
- **Broadcasting Operations**: Efficient distance calculations for all combinations
- **Memory Management**: Optimized array operations to minimize memory usage
- **Vectorized Processing**: Eliminates nested loops for grid operations

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Pixel-level reconstruction accuracy (lower = better)
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**: Perceptual similarity (0-1, higher = better)
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Signal quality in dB (higher = better)

### Computational Performance
- **Processing Time**: End-to-end mosaic generation time
- **Scalability Analysis**: Performance vs grid size relationship
- **Implementation Comparison**: Vectorized vs loop-based speedup analysis

### Typical Performance Results

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Color Space Conversion
The LAB color space provides perceptually uniform distances, meaning that equal numerical differences correspond to equal perceived color differences. This results in more visually pleasing tile selections compared to RGB space.

### Vectorized Operations
By reshaping images into grid structures and using NumPy broadcasting, we eliminate nested loops and leverage optimized C implementations for significant performance gains.

### Memory Efficiency
The system processes images in chunks and uses view-based operations where possible to minimize memory allocation and copying.
